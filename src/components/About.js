          Spirituality is a term that is often used to describe a person's
          connection with their inner self. It can also be defined as one's
          search for meaning. In the modern world, spirituality has become more
          popular and more widely accepted among men than it was in the past. In
          today's society, many people are seeking ways to reconnect with
          themselves and find meaning in life. Spirituality has been a way for
          many people to do this by connecting with their inner selves and
          finding meaning in life.
